**about page**
about section:
DRAFT
Coding became a passion of mine within days.
I am currently pursing a career in computer programming through the CodeCrew coding
boot camp. I spend my days solving puzzles and my nights experimenting with code I 
don't yet understand. One week into the boot camp I knew that I had found my true passion.
I have a background in design and concern myself with aesthetic and content equally.
I look to combine the sometimes frustrating rationality of code with the always frustrating
subjectivity of design to reach beautiful solutions to complex problems. I've spent my whole
life in Memphis and this vibrant city and surrounding towns offer inspiration for everyone at
every turn. I aspire to tap into the pulsing vein of computer programming that runs 
throughout the city and add to its energy tenfold.
