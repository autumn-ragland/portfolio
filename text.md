DRAFT
Coding became a passion of mine within days.
I am currently pursing a career in computer programming through the CodeCrew coding
boot camp. I spend my days solving puzzles and my nights experimenting with code I 
don't yet understand. One week into the boot camp I knew that I had found my true passion.
I have a background in design and concern myself with aesthetic and content equally.
I look to combine the sometimes frustrating rationality of code with the always frustrating
subjectivity of design to reach beautiful solutions to complex problems. I've spent my whole
life in Memphis and this vibrant city and surrounding towns offer inspiration for everyone at
every turn. I aspire to tap into the pulsing vein of computer programming that runs 
throughout the city and add to its energy tenfold.

reflection heading:
Each week of my coding bootcamp I film, edit, and upload a video describing the material
covered in the week and my progress and struggles. These videos are a joy to film and edit. Click 
the week number to view the video on youtube.
reflections01:
The first week of code crew code school was an introduction to coding. We covered using the terminal, github,
a basic python overview, intellij and a basic javascript introduction. This week was full of new and exciting information
about coding and the specifics of CodeCrew's program. Click to number 01 to view the fill video describing my impression 
of the first week!
reflections02:
The second week of coding bottcamp provided a more in-depth look into JavaScript. We learned the basics of arrays,classes and objects,
switch case, and scope. We also began a python introduction. Two languages in one wek! Click the number 02 to view
the full video describing my impression of the second week.
reflections03:
By the third week I had finally settled into the structure of the class and found an effective study method. This week we learned python
basics. We covered loops,string formatting,data types, and functions. Python and JavaScript built on one another nicely 
and this week went smoothly. Click the number 03 the view the full video describing my impression of the third week.
reflections04:
The fourth week was a relatively simple introduction to HTML and CSS. We began the week with a brief review of python and quickly moved into
creating simple webpages. This was one of my favorite weeks so far. Click the number 04 to view the full video describing
my impressions of the fourth week along with a few example of the webpages we designed.
reflections05:
Week five brought most of the skills we have been learning so far together. We linked JavaScript files to our HTML files to make
our webpages dynamic. We also learned JQuery this week. These introductions made our webpages a little more complex. Click the number 05
